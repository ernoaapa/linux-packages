# Linux packages
This repository contains some packages (Docker images) for [linuxkit](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit).

The [kubelet](pkg/kubelet) and [cri-containerd](pkg/cri-containerd) are originally from [https://github.com/linuxkit/kubernetes]() but at the moment, there's no ARM versions available.
